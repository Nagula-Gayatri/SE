Kubernetes with Minikube (Standalone)
Pre-requisites

Docker must be running (you already confirmed this).

Minikube installed (or download from Minikube
).

A Docker image ready (either your own or nginx for testing).

Start Minikube

Open PowerShell and run:

minikube start --driver=docker


Wait until Minikube starts.

Check status:

minikube status

Check deployments
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods


If you don’t have any deployments yet, it’s fine — we’ll create one.

Create a deployment

Use your Docker image from Docker Hub (or just use nginx for testing):

kubectl create deployment mynginx --image=nginx


Check pods:

kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pods

Expose deployment

Expose it as a NodePort to access in browser:

kubectl expose deployment mynginx --type=NodePort --port=80 --target-port=80


Check the service:

kubectl get services


Access in browser via Minikube:

minikube service mynginx


Your nginx page should open.

At the end of this step

Minikube running

Deployment created and exposed

Pod is running and accessible in browser
